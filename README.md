## 📝 Project Description
**My Favourite Moments** is a personal photography portfolio website that showcases my favorite captured moments.  
The website highlights my biography, passion for photography, and different categories of photos such as wild life, rainbow scenes, and beach views.

Each picture tells a story, and this project is a space where I cherish and share my photography journey.
